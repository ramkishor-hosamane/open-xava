        Eclipse
      </h1>
      Since v6.4 OpenXava includes OpenXava Studio, so you don't need an
      additional IDE to work with OpenXava. OpenXava Studio is based on Eclipse
      but is lighter and more beautiful. Moreover, you can install any Eclipse
      plugin you need on top of OpenXava Studio and change or customize the
      visual theme, to have a light theme or color icons, for example. Anyways,
      if you prefer to work with your own Eclipse you can. </div>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">Open your own Eclipse and choose <i>File
        &gt; Switch Workspace &gt; Other...</i> There select the workspace
      included with OpenXava:</div>
    <p><img src="files/eclipse-choose-workspace_en.png" alt="eclipse-choose-workspace_en.png"

        title="eclipse-choose-workspace_en.png"><span style="color: #505050;"><span

          style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><br>
        </span></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #505050;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If
          your Eclipse version is not the exact one used by OpenXava Studio,
          Eclipse will say you that the workspace is older or newer, don't worry
          just accept. Eclipse does a good work migrating workspace versions.
          You can use from a Eclipse Neon to the very last Eclipse version
          without any problem. Indeed, the instructions of Getting Started guide
          should work with your own version of Eclipse.<br>
        </span></span></p>
    <div class="wiki" style="display: block;">OpenXava projects are WTP
      projects, so if you use Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers, you
      can add a Tomcat server in the <i>Servers</i> tab and add your OpenXava
      applications to it.<br>
